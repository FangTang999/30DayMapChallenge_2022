# 30DayMapChallenge_2022

I’m a member of ASU Trans+AI Lab, https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab. It’s really exciting to join this daily mapmaking challenge based around different themes. The related open-source tool, GTFS2GMNS, can be found on ASU Trans+AI Lab webpage: https://lnkd.in/dxqKXuWu

## Day 1: Points
The following picture represents the transit stations in Phoenix which is created by GTFS2GMNS.

## Day 2: Lines
As shown in the following picture, the lines with different colors represent the transit routes with different directions in Phoenix.

## Day 3: Polygons

As shown in the following map, it shows the Polygons representing the different TAZs in Phoenix.

Would you like to know how to prepare the TAZs for your interest area? I summarized a few methods and wrote an instruction for users. Please find it at https://lnkd.in/gedThkcv.

## Day 4: Green Friday
The following map with green blocks represents the POIs generated by osm2gmns tool, https://lnkd.in/gtUx4PKq.

## Day 5: Ukraine
Today I prepared a Flixbus route for Ukraine, FLIXBUS:K1860, which is serving Kyiv and international destinations.

Would you like to create a transit network for your interest locations or agencies? The open-source package, GTFS2GMNS, can help you do it easily. https://lnkd.in/dxqKXuWu

## Day 6: Network
As shown in the following map, a multi-modal transit network for 20 agencies in Washington DC was generated by the GTFS2GMNS, https://lnkd.in/dxqKXuWu. The network includes boarding links which are the links connecting stations to corresponding virtual stations, service links representing the planning of each route, and transfer links between different stations. More details can be found at https://lnkd.in/gETRRimz.

## Day 7: Raster
Gird2demand, https://lnkd.in/geEJNGpY, is an open-source trip generation and distribution tool generating zone-to-zone travel demand based on alphanumeric grid zones. Users can customize the size of gride, just like selecting different pixels to analyze the traffic network.

The following map represents the Market Street gride map. The Gird2demand can read map data from both OpenStreetMap and BBBike. The test dataset and code can be found at https://lnkd.in/gtrYTp4G.

## Day 8: Data-OpenStreetMap
As shown in the following maps, I collected ten maps for interest universities from OpenStreetMap, and then convert them to readable, sharing networks in GMNS format utilizing the OSM2GMNS, https://lnkd.in/gtUx4PKq. You can find the datasets at https://lnkd.in/g6MJjS6M.

## Day 9: Space
As shown in the following map, I uitilized MapMatching4GMNS tool, https://lnkd.in/gyAhVN-D, to match TMC locations to the planning network of Loop 303 NorthBound corridor in Arizona.
<img width="853" alt="Day_9_Space" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38580581/201159405-34f5757d-ce5d-41ef-92e6-d5356334d66d.png">

## Day 10: A bad map
Bad map for modeling? Not a problem. OSM2GMNS, https://lnkd.in/gtUx4PKq, has a solution!

As shown in the following picture, map (1) is a negative example with two signal nodes corresponding to one intersection. Fortunately, the OSM2GMNS tool has a function to consolidate intersections, as shown in (2), from (a) to (b).

Since #openstreetmap has a high map accuracy across 30 Cities, https://lnkd.in/g4nChBye, OSM2GMNS can generate a high-quality network with GMNS format.
